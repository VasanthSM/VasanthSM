# **Welcome! I'm Vasanth** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer with a deep focus on **clean code**, **React**, and crafting scalable, high-performance web applications. Currently, Iâ€™m working at **Infoane Technologies**, where I specialize in building modern front-end solutions using **TypeScript**, **Redux**, **RTK Query**, and **Storybook**, alongside back-end services with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.

I thrive on exploring new technologies and design patterns to enhance both the functionality and user experience of the applications I create. My mission is to consistently write maintainable, efficient code while learning and growing as a developer to stay at the forefront of web development.

Beyond coding, I take great pride in mentoring and guiding emerging developers, sharing knowledge, and collaborating with others to foster growth within the tech community.
